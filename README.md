# SnakeGame
The Snake game is a popular arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves continuously around the screen. The objective is to eat food items that appear randomly, which causes the snake to grow longer. The challenge is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body, which causes the game to end.
